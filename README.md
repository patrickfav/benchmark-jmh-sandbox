# JMH Benchmark Sandbox

A catch-all repo for all kinds of JMH benchmarks. Find reports of the benchmark in the `reports` folder. This is just to quickly try and compare performance of arbitrary code that does not fit into any of my other projects.

## How to run

The easiest way is to use the [JMH plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7529-jmh-plugin) with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). There is a maven script that will package everything to a `.jar` but no default main class is set.
